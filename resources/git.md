## Remotes

*Simplest definition*: A remote points to a URL where project code may be sent, or pushed to.  
Not all projects need a remote, but in the case of projects you want to share or collaborate on, remotes are very useful. Standard practice is to add an `orign` remote that points to a GitHub URL where others may find your project online.
